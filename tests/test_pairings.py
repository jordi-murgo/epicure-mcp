"""Regression + performance tests for the vectorised pairings algorithm.

The find_pairings algorithm is the only tool with O(N) inner loops, so
we keep:
  - a structural equivalence test (top primaries + bridges are stable
    against accidental algorithmic drift), and
  - a latency budget (a 200 ms ceiling on the 1,790-ingredient bundle
    is well above the current ~5 ms steady-state and will catch any
    accidental re-introduction of per-row Python loops).
